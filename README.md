# Nexter
Nexter is a fictional company for real estate.

The website is a landing page for the company,built as part of advance css and sass course.
This site was part of the grid practice, and implements advance grid techniques.
In addition, I've added some Javascript to create more authentic feel to the app (mainly with the messages).
